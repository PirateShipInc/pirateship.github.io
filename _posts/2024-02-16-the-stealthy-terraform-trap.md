In this dive, we unravel the art of turning a seemingly innocuous line of Terraform code into a devastating vector for enterprise compromise. Prepare to explore the stealthy mechanics and strategic cunning behind planting and executing a backdoor that flies under the radar of modern defenses, proving that sometimes the most potent threats to corporate security lurk in the least expected places.

This research was originally presented during the NullByte Security Conference 2022 that took place in November 2022 in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil.

## Introduction

In the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape, where companies deploy sophisticated defenses, attackers and researchers must innovate to breach these systems discreetly. Our latest research focuses on leveraging Infrastructure as Code (IaC) pipelines, vital for enterprise infrastructure but also vulnerable to exploitation. We aimed to create undetectable access methods that blend into legitimate processes and bypass conventional security, highlighting the strategic battle between security and subversion.

Terraform by HashiCorp streamlines complex infrastructure management, its widespread use and critical role making it a prime target for cyber attacks. Our research demonstrates that altering just a single line in a Terraform project can initiate unauthorized actions. By embedding malicious functions within Terraform providers, we exploit its trusted status to perform covert operations, showcasing the ease with which these tools can be weaponized for data exfiltration and espionage, all while remaining undetected within normal IaC processes.

## Background

Before we dig deeper into the malicious activities, we must understand some concepts of what we are exploiting.

**How Terraform works?**

Terraform relies on two pivotal commands: `init` and `apply`. The `init` command is crucial for initializing a Terraform project. It downloads and installs the necessary providers, which are extensions that Terraform uses to manage resources across various cloud platforms. This command also prepares the project's environment, organizing the working directory by generating essential configuration and state files to track infrastructure changes.

Following initialization, the `apply` command activates the project's infrastructure blueprint, interpreting Terraform configuration files to ensure the infrastructure aligns with the specified design. It presents a detailed plan of the intended changes for user confirmation, proceeding to provision or update resources upon approval. Together, these commands facilitate Terraform's infrastructure as code methodology, enhancing the integration of planning and execution.

## Crafting the Stealthy Provider

For our demonstration, we've chosen the AWS Terraform provider as our target, focusing on capturing and exfiltrating AWS Credentials from the host. Our process begins by cloning the official provider from its GitHub repository at [`https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws`](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws).

Once we have our own copy, our primary task is to understand how the provider processes and stores credentials. Our exploration led us to a key piece of code within the provider's source, located in [`terraform-provider-aws/internal/conns/config.go`](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/blob/cb64b2a54db44b45509affeb46a23845d1857e89/internal/conns/config.go#L65). The following snippet is pivotal:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/thau0x01/2bfabda4081aacf5f03649e62286c21c.js"></script>

This code segment is critical as it handles the AWS client's configuration, including credentials. Our goal is to modify the provider subtly to intercept these credentials during execution and transmit them to us, exploiting this function's handling of sensitive data.


**Capturing the creds**
To capture the credentials we've built a golang library that was then embedded into the provider during it's build process, just before release. 


**The Art of Stealthy Exfiltration**

We employed a data exfiltration technique that leverages DNS queries, a method traditionally neglected by security defenses. This approach not only maintains a low detection profile but also exploits the free passage of DNS traffic in many networks, ensuring our operations remain undetectable.

**Demonstrating Efficacy**

Our controlled environment tests confirmed the provider's ability to silently intercept and transmit AWS credentials, emphasizing the critical need for heightened security measures within automation tools and the necessity of scrutinizing trusted IT components.

### **Defense Strategies: Fortifying Against IaC Threats**

The revelation of our malicious Terraform provider's capabilities highlights the urgent need for strengthened defenses in IaC-utilizing environments. We propose a layered security approach, emphasizing prevention, detection, and response.

**1. Rigorous Validation and Review**

Ensuring the legitimacy and security of third-party providers is crucial. This involves thorough vetting, community feedback analysis, and stringent code review processes to detect vulnerabilities or malicious code.

**2. Advanced Monitoring and Logging**

Enhanced DNS traffic monitoring and comprehensive logging of IaC activities are vital for identifying and investigating suspicious behaviors, offering insights into potential data exfiltration attempts.

**3. Stringent Access Controls**

Implementing RBAC and MFA fortifies defense against credential theft, limiting access to necessary operations and adding an extra security layer for critical system and service access.

**4. Continuous Education and Vigilance**

Regular security training for infrastructure management teams, coupled with staying abreast of IaC security trends, is essential for early threat detection and mitigation.

**5. Adoption of Specialized Security Tools**

Employing IaC-specific scanning tools and anomaly detection systems can significantly enhance the detection of misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and unusual activities indicative of a compromise.

### **Conclusion**

The advent of sophisticated IaC and DNS-based attacks necessitates a proactive and comprehensive security strategy. By adopting the outlined defense strategies, organizations can safeguard against the stealthy tactics exemplified by our malicious Terraform provider, reinforcing the security of modern enterprise infrastructures in an era of continuous digital evolution.
